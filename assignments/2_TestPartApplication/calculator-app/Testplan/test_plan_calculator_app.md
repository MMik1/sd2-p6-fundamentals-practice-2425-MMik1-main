# Test Plan for Calculator Application
This test plan outlines the strategy and resources for testing the Calculator Application.

## 1. Test Strategy
- Unit Test - to verify the api nodes in the backend via Unit Testing.

## 2. Features to be Tested
- Correct calculation for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiply and division).
- Handling of edge cases (division by zero).
- Proper error messages for invalid inputs (invalid input handling).

## 3. Test Cases (Unit Testing)
- The file `operations.test.js` contains all Unit Tests.
- The JEST library is used to test the different endpoints in the backend.
- In the README.md more information on how to start the tests.

> **Note 1:** The frontend of the Calculator App is NOT tested here. Only the back-end API.

> **Note 2:** The frontend of the Calculator App could be tested with Selenium.**
